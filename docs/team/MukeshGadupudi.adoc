== Project: TeachConnect

== 1. Overview
*TeachConnect (TC)* is command line application designed to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. It is an application for a user who loves to type - in other words, it uses a *Command Line Interface (CLI)*. All output is displayed on a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* - which is just the computer application screen. If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional contact books.

== 2. Purpose of Portfolio Page

This portfolio was made to document all contributions I made to the project. +
The contents included are:

. The external behavior of my contributions.
. The justification for their implementation.
. Details of the implementation.

It also includes some of the other contributions I made â€“ Testing, PR reviews and Project Management.

== 3. Summary of Contributions

*Major enhancement*: Sharing of Contacts +
*What it does*: allows users to import or export contacts in various file formats depending on conditions the user gives. +
*Justification* : Teachers in general take up new classes and hence it is necessary for them to share the contact details of all the students in the class. They are also very sociable people and exchanging contacts between themselves should be made as simple and seamless as possible.

*Minor enhancements*: Creating Personalised Shortcuts for any command +
*What it does*: allows users to set multiple shortcuts for any command they wish. They can also choose to delete shortcuts. +
*Justification* : TeachConnect comes with a lot of features and each feature has its own command word. The most gruelling part is remembering the exact command word as stated in the user guide. To overcome this the shortcut command helps keep aliases to the commands there by helping teachers better remember the command words they are comfortable with.

=== A.2 Enhancement Proposed: Saving Data on Server

==== External Behaviour

This feature will make sure the data of contacts and reminders is stored in the servers online. The data files and images are stored on the cloud and cannot be directly changed by opening them on your device.

This will be automatically done once the user register in the application.
The files are encrypted using the SHA algorithm to prevent it from being read by others. This ensures that your data is secure and there is no privacy law violation.

==== Justification

This feature will make the product more personalised as the user will have to register to use this application.

Moreover, the user can now access his data from any device as it is stored on cloud storage. The data cannot be directly manipulated since it is on cloud and hence the application won't crash as data will never be corrupted.

==== Implementation

A login feature will be first implemented to identify users uniquely.

Through the following use case diagram, signing up of user will allow data to be stored on cloud which can downloaded anytime for backup purposes.
