== Introduction

TeachConnect (TC) is created to help teachers and other educational professionals to *better manage their contacts* and *remenber students that they had taught*. TeachConnect is also tailored for teachers who would *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. Most importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
